# Redbus Data Scraping & Filtering Application
**Introduction:**
This project focuses on scraping data from the Redbus website using Selenium, storing the data in a SQL database, and developing an interactive Streamlit application for filtering and analysis.

**Problem Statement:**
The "Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application" aims to revolutionize the transportation industry by providing a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing bus travel data. By utilizing Selenium for web scraping, this project automates the extraction of detailed information from Redbus, including bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability. By streamlining data collection and providing powerful tools for data-driven decision-making, this project can significantly improve operational efficiency and strategic planning in the transportation industry.

**Key Technologies:**
1. Web Scraping: Selenium
2. Programming Language: Python
3. Web Framework: Streamlit
4. Database: SQL

**Business Use Cases:**
1. **Travel Aggregators:** 
   Real-time bus schedules and seat availability.
2. **Market Analysis:** 
   Analyzing travel patterns and preferences.
3. **Customer Service:** 
   Customized travel options.
4. **Competitor Analysis:**
   Comparing pricing and service levels.

**Approach:**
1. Data Scraping: Use Selenium to scrape Redbus data.
2. Data Storage: Store data in a SQL database.
3. Streamlit Application: Develop an application for data filtering.
4. Data Analysis/Filtering using Streamlit:Use SQL queries to retrieve and filter data based on user inputs.Use Streamlit to allow users to interact with and filter the data through the application.

**Project Deliverables:**
1. Source Code: Python scripts for scraping and application.
2. Database Schema: SQL scripts for database creation.
3. Application: A Streamlit app for data interaction.

**Install Required Libraries:**

      pip install selenium
      pip install pymysql
      pip install pandas
      pip install streamlit
      pip install streamlit-option-menu
      pip install streamlit_lottie
      pip install requests  

**Result:**
he project successfully automates the extraction of detailed bus travel data from Redbus, including routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability, using Selenium. This data is stored in a well-structured SQL database for easy access and querying.The interactive Streamlit application allows users to filter and analyze the data based on various criteria such as route, schedule, price, and seat availability. This enables real-time decision-making for businesses in the transportation industry, such as travel aggregators and market analysts, by providing actionable insights into travel patterns and competitor pricing.
Overall, the project streamlines data collection, enhances data accessibility, and provides valuable tools for data-driven decision-making in the transportation sector.
